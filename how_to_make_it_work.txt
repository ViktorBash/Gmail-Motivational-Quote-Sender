Hi! This app only works with gmail right now, (but you can probably tinker with it to get it working
 with other email providers). These python files were made in Pycharm.
To make this program work, you need to do 2 things. 
1. Fill out in the nice_email_messages.py file your information. Ex: Password, email addresses, etc.
You don't have to fill out the config.py file, because it will automatically get written to and filled
by the nice_email_messages.py file. 
2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and turn this feature of gmail on for whatever 
account is sending the email. If you don't do this, it will not work. 
Also, this does make the email more vulnerable, so only turn this on when using the email for this, 
or make an email just to use this program.
Thanks!
